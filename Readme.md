## Abstract
We propose a <b>Transformer-based</b> framework for 3D human texture estimation from a single image. The proposed Transformer is able to effectively exploit the global information of the input image, overcoming the limitations of existing methods that are solely based on convolutional neural networks. In addition, we also propose a mask-fusion strategy to combine the advantages of the RGB-based and texture-flow-based models. We further introduce a part-style loss to help reconstruct high-fidelity colors without introducing unpleasant artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art 3D human texture estimation approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.


## Overview
<img src='github_imgs/overview.png' alt='Overview of Texformer' />

The Query is a pre-computed color encoding of the UV space obtained by mapping the 3D coordinates of a standard human body mesh to the UV space. The Key is a concatenation of the input image and the 2D part-segmentation map. The Value is a concatenation of the input image and its 2D coordinates. We first feed the Query, Key, and Value into three CNNs to transform them into feature space. Then the multi-scale features are sent to the Transformer units to generate the Output features. The multi-scale Output features are processed and fused in another CNN, which produces the RGB UV map <i>T</i>, texture flow <i>F</i>, and fusion mask <i>M</i>. The final UV map is generated by combining <i>T</i> and the textures sampled with <i>F</i> using the fusion mask <i>M</i>. Note that we have skip connections between the same-resolution layers of the CNNs similar to [1] which have been omitted in the figure for brevity.

## Install


## Download
* Download [meta data](), and put it in "./meta/".

* Download [pretrained model](), and put it in "./pretrained".

* We propose an enhanced Market-1501 dataset, termed as SMPLMarket, by equipping the original data with SMPL estimation from [RSC-Net]() and body part segmentation estimated by [EANet](). 
Please download the [SMPLMarket]() dataset and put it in "./datasets/". 

* Other datasets: [PRW](), [surreal](), [CUHK-SYSU]().
Please put these datasets in "./datasets/".

* All the paths are set in "config.py".

## Demo
Run the model with human part segmentation from an off-the-shelf model:
```
python demo.py --img_path demo_imgs/test1_img.png --seg_path demo_imgs/test1_seg.png
```

If you don't want to run an external model for human part segmentation, you can use the human part segmentation of RSC-Net instead (note that this may affect the performance as the segmentation of RSC-Net is not very accurate due to the limitation of the SMPL model):
```
python demo.py --img_path demo_imgs/test1_img.png
```

## Train
Run the training code with default settings:
```
python trainer.py --exp_name texformer
```

## Evaluation
Run the evaluation on the SPMLMarket dataset:
```
python eval.py --checkpoint_path ./pretrained/texformer_ep500.pt
```
